## Structure (Microservice architecture)

## Implementation

The marking will be strongly influenced by the quality and quantity of features you can implement. For each main feature, you MUST have an end-to-end test to show it, and also you need to discuss it in the documentation. A feature without tests and documentation is like a feature that does not exist. For B/A grades, the more features you implement and test in your project, the better.

## Technologies

Which different technologies you did choose to use

## Developers

For each student, a brief description of your individual contributions to the project. Also make
sure to specify your Git user-names so examiners can verify what you wrote based on the Git history. Furthermore, make sure that, for each student, you specify which is the main REST service s/he is responsible for.
